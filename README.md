# stockMonitor

A Shiny app for monitoring stocks - the "View Stocks" panel is for looking at the market activity of a single stock (prices and trading volume), and the "Analyse Stocks" panel allows you to compare up to 7 stocks simultaneously over a time frame.

Am aiming to further this project in the future - i.e. improve its speed, functionalities, etc.
