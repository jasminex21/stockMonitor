A Shiny app for monitoring stocks - the *View Stocks* panel is for looking at the market activity of a single stock, and the *Analyse Stocks* panel allows you to compare up to 7 stocks simultaneously over a time frame.

### The *View Stocks* Panel
A finance web app at first view may look intimidating, so there is an "About this Page" button that will introduce users to each of the controls and briefly explain what they will show. For the more advanced user, a variety of technical indicators have been made available that will provide detailed insight into market patterns.

### The *Analyse Stocks* Panel
This panel is mainly for if you would like to look at several - up to 7 - stocks at the same time. It involves an interactive plot with functionalities that facilitate stock comparison. At the moment this panel only includes the stocks of the 100 top companies based on market capacity.

### Just a Note
This was a personal project that I explored to try and further my highly limited knowledge in finance - I'd say it was fairly successful in that aim. That being said, I hope to expand the abilities of this web app as my scope of knowledge increases.
